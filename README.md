Build Instructions
==================

[The talk](http://tharte.github.io/mbt/mbt.html) should build out of the box from the
source file `mbt.org` in one of two ways:

0. from Emacs: in `mbt.org` export to HTML with `C-c C-e h h`
0. from the command line: simply type `make`, which will invoke Emacs in batch mode
